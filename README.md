# Basic-Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow
This project-based on Basic Image Classification with Keras and TensorFlow. In this project, I will learn the basics of using Keras with TensorFlow as its backend and i will learn to use it to solve a basic image classification problem. By the end of this 2-hour long project, i will have created, trained, and evaluated a Neural Network model that, after the training, will be able to predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy. You also will have learned the fundamentals of Neural Networks, TensorFlow and Keras.
